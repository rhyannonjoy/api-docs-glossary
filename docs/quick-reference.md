### 12 cognitive dimensions of API usability

Framework for evaluating and enhancing the
usability of APIs

## A

### Affect vs effect 

Affect (_verb_): to influence\
Effect (_noun_): the result

### Agile

Project management method\
Breaks projects down into smaller phases, relies on iterative cycles

### API

Application programming interface

### API overview topic

Landing page in which the audience is everyone

### API reference topic

"Getting finished topics" that describe aspects of an API
operation or object

### API security

Measures taken to protect APIs from unauthorized access, misuse, attacks

### Artificial intelligence (AI)

Both a research field and set of technologies that use computers and large
datasets to perform tasks, make predictions or recommendations and solve
problems that normally require human intelligence

### Authentication

Determines who you are

### Authorization

Determines what you can do

## B

### Branch

Parallel version of a repository

## C

### Cherry-pick

Copying selected commits from one branch to another branch

### Clone

Copy of a repository that lives on your in your development environment,
instead of hosted on GitHub

### Commit

Repository snapshot at a certain point-in-time, has a hash

### Commit hash

Unique identifier generated using the SHA-1 hash function

### Content

Anything you write for someone else to read

### Critical chain project management (CCPM)

Project management method\
Focuses on resources needed to complete the project’s tasks by adding
resource availability to the critical path

### Critical path method (CPM)

Project management method\
Some tasks you can’t start until you finish the previous one

### cURL

Client URL, command-Line tool available on Windows, MacOS, Linux

## D

### Document development life cycle (DDLC)

Process of writing and delivering particular content in the form
of documentation - PDF, Word doc, online articles, website content

### Domain knowledge

Understanding of a specific industry, discipline, or activity

## E

### End-user software engineer

Way to describe and categorize different developer work styles,
characteristics, and motivations that are common to particular
groups of people or personas using products

## F

### Force-push

Moving changes upstream that rewrite commits that are already present upstream

### Fork

Personal copy of another user’s repository that lives
in your GitHub account, a forked repository

## G

### Generative AI

Draws upon the patterns identified through machine learning processes to generate
new content

### Git

Command-line program that executes version control functions

### Git base

Command-line interface for Windows and MacOS that emultes Unix Bash command line

### GitHub

Cloud-based storage, version control, automation service

### GitHub Desktop

User interface that manages GitHub repositories and local clones

### Graphical user interface (GUI)

Form of user interface with graphical icons and visual indicators

### Guerilla usability testing (GUT)

Way to assess how effective an interface is by testing out
its visual design, capability, and general message on its
intended audience and capturing their responses

## H

### Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)

Synchronous request/response protocol

### Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS)

Secure version of HTTP

## L

### Large language model (LLM)

Form of generative AI that's trained on enormous amounts of texts
and can generate text-based responses that look and feel human-like

## M

### Machine learning

Practice of using algorithms and large datasets to train computers
to recognize patterns and to apply what's known about those patterns
to complete new tasks

### Markdown

Markup language designed to format plain text documents

### Market

Space in which customers access your company or products

### Merge

Moving the changes from one branch to another branch

### Merge conflict

2 commits have changes in the same file, blocking merging,
requires manual resolution

### Merge commit

Combines changes in 1 branch with the changes that took place
in the original branch after

## N

### Natural language processing (NLP)

Ability of computers to analyze and generate responses in ways
that mimic humans’ use of language

## O

### OpenAPI specification (OAS)

Way to define the interface of an API, used to create
the interface and documentation

### Origin repository

Default upstream repository, typically clone source repository

## P

### Postman

App that creates and records HTTP/HTTPS requests and responses

### Project management methodology

Different ways to approach a project

### Pull

Fetching changes from upstream, such as pulling the changes
down from an origin or upstream repository

### Pull request (PR)

Request to someone that invites them to pull your changes from
a repository/branch into their repository

### Push

Moving changes upstream, such as from your local computer
to its origin repository

## R

### Rebase

Used to resync a feature branch to its source branch
after the source branch has changed

### Repository

Place to store files that are under Git’s version control

### REST APIs

*RE*presentational state transfer interface, one of the most
widely used approaches for building web-based APIs

### Rhetorical approach

Also known as "the tone" or editorial voice

## S

### Sales collateral

Used to inform and educate, either internal, empower sales reps,
or external, convert new customers

### Scrum

Project management method\
Work in short-cycles of 2 weeks call “sprints”
and meet daily to discuss work

### Skunkworks

Used in business, engineering, and technical fields to describe a group
within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered
by bureaucracy, with the task of working on advanced or secret projects

### Squash

Action of combining many commits into a single commit

## U

### Upstream repository

Original repository, source of fork

### Usability testing

Practice of testing how easy a design is to use with
a group of representative users

### User interface (UI)

Space where interactions between humans and machines occur

## V

### Version control

System that tracks changes in documents and other files

## W

### Waterfall

Project management method\
Traditional, sequential, linear, simple, idealistic

### Workspace

Directory on your computer that contains your cloned repoitories
