### 12 Cognitive Dimensions of API Usability

A framework for evaluation and enhancing the
usability of APIs

## A

**Affect vs Effect**: “affect is a verb meaning 'to influence' and effect is a noun
meaning 'the result'."

**Agile**: project management method -
breaks projects down into smaller phases, relies on iterative cycles

**API**: application programming interface

**API Overview Topic**: the landing page in which the audience is everyone

**API Reference Topic**: "getting finished topics" that describe aspects of an API
operation or object

**API Security**: the measures taken to protect APIs from unauthorized access, misuse,
and attacks.

**Artificial Intelligence** (AI): both a research field and set of technologies that use
computers and large datasets to perform tasks, make predictions or recommendations and
solve problems that normally require human intelligence

**Authentication**: determines who you are

**Authorization**: determines what you can do

## B

**Branch**: a parallel version of a repository

## C

**Cherry-pick**: copying selected commits from one branch to another branch

**Clone**: a cloned repository - a copy of a repository that lives on your
computer, in your development environment, instead of hosted on GitHub

**Commit**: repository snapshot at a certain point-in-time, has a unique ID called the hash

**Content**: "anything you write for someone else to read"

**Critical chain project management** (CCPM): project management method
focuses on resources needed to complete the project’s tasks by adding resource
availability to the critical path

**Critical Path Method** (CPM): project management method -
some tasks you can’t start until you finish the previous one

**cURL**: client URL, Command-Line tool available on Windows, MacOS, Linux

## D

**Document Development Life Cycle** (DDLC): process of writing and delivering particular content in the form
of documentation - PDF, Word doc, online articles, website content

**Domain Knowledge**: the understanding of a specific industry, discipline or activity

## E

**End-user Software Engineer**: way to describe and categorize different developer work styles, characteristics
and motivations that are common to particular groups of people or personas using products

## F

**Force-push**: moving changes upstream that rewrite commits that are already present upstream

**Fork**: a forked repository - a personal copy of another user’s repository that lives in your GitHub account

## G

**Generative AI**: draws upon the patterns identified through machine learning processes to generate
new content

**Git**: command-line program that executes version control functions

**Git Base**: command-line interface for Windows and MacOS that emultes Unix Bash command line

**GitHub**: cloud-based storage, version control, automation service

**GitHub Desktop**: user interface that manages GitHub repositories and local clones

**Graphical user interface** (GUI): form of user interface with graphical icons and visual indicators

**Guerilla Usability Testing** (GUT): a way to assess how effective an interface is by testing
out its visual design, capability and general message on its intended audience and capturing their responses

## H

**HyperText Transfer Protocol**: synchronous request/response protocol

## L

**Large language model** (LLM): form of generative AI that's trained on enormous amounts of texts and can generate
text-based responses that look and feel human-like

## M

**Machine Learning**: the practice of using algorithms + large datasets to train computers to recognize
patterns and to apply what's known about those patterns to complete new tasks

**Markdown**: markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, designed to format plain text documents

**Market**: the space in which customers access your company or products

**Merge**: moving the changes from one branch to another branch

**Merge conflict**: 2 commits have changes in the same file, requires manual resolution

**Merge commit**: combines changes in 1 branch with the changes that took place in the original branch after

## N

**Natural language processing**(NLP): the ability of computers to analyze and generate responses
in ways that mimic humans’ use of language, possible through machine learning.

## O

**OpenAPI Specification** (OAS): a way to define the interface of an API, used to create the interface + documentation

**Origin repository**: the default upstream repository, typically the clone source repository

## P

**Postman**: app that creates and records HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses

**Project Management Methodology**: different ways to approach a project

**Pull**: fetching changes from upstream, such as pulling the changes down from an origins or upstream repo

**Pull Request** (PR): request to someone that invites them to pull your changes from a repo/branch into their repo

**Push**: moving changes upstream, such as from your local computer to its origin repo

## R

**Rebase**: used to resync a feature branch to its source branch after the source branch has changed

**Repository**: a place to store files that are under Git’s version control

**REST APIs** : *re*presentational state transfer interface, one of the most widely used approaches
for building web-based APIs

**Rhetorical Approach**: also known as "the tone"

## S

**Sales collateral**: used to inform and educate, either internal, empower sales reps, or external,
convert new customers

**Scrum**:  project management method -
work in short-cycles of 2 weeks call “sprints” and meet daily to discuss work

**Skunkworks**: phrase used in business, engineering and technical fields to describe a group
within an organization given a high degree of autonomy and unhampered by bureaucracy, with
the task of working on advanced or secret projects

**Squash**: the action of combining many commits into a single commit

## U

**Upstream repository**: the original repository from which a forked repo was taken

**Usability Testing**: the practice of testing how easy a design is to use with a group of
representative users

**User Interface** (UI): the space where interactions between humans and machines occur

## V

**Version control**: system that tracks changes in documents + other files

## W

**Waterfall**: a project management method -
traditional, sequential, linear, simple, idealistic

**Workspace**: the directory on your computer that contains your cloned repoitories
