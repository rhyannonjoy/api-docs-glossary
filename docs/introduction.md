# Introduction

Welcome to the API Docs Glossary. From REST fundamentals to documentation
best practices, API Docs Glossary is a comprehensive reference for anyone
working with API documentation. Whether you're a technical writer,
developer, or student learning API documentation, this resource provides
clear definitions and context for essential concepts.

## Why this glossary?

This glossary emerged organically from real learning needs during the
University of Washington's AI-Enhanced API Documentation certification
program. The project began as study notes - a way to define and
cross-reference terms from course materials, industry resources, and
hands-on work. What started as personal reference material quickly
evolved into something more comprehensive, and comprehensive enough
that the course instructor called it a "hidden gem" and encouraged
sharing it with the broader Write the Docs community.

**What makes this resource different:**

- **Learner-perspective definitions**: terms include the context that
help concepts click, rather than isolated dictionary-style definitions
- **AI-enhanced focus**: reflects the evolving intersection of AI and
API documentation practices
- **Curated from certification coursework**: draws from
industry-recognized curriculum and best practices taught in the
UW program
- **Practical context**: each entry connects theory to real-world use,
bridging the gap between learning and doing
- **A living document**: terms are regularly updated as the field evolves,
reflecting current industry practices and emerging technologies

This resource serves as a practical reference built from a
learner's journey, designed for learners and practitioners who want
clear explanations grounded in current API documentation practices.

## Scope & approach

This glossary covers:

- API architecture and design patterns
- Documentation types and best practices  
- Tools commonly used in API documentation workflows
- Processes for creating and maintaining API docs
- AI applications in technical documentation

Each entry includes practical context and real-world applications,
not just definitions.
