## draw.io

**Definition**: also known as `diagrams.net` - free, open source diagramming tool
for creating flowcharts, network diagrams, UML - _unified modeling language_ -
diagrams, and technical architecture visualizations

**Purpose**: enables tech writers to create professional diagrams without licensing
costs; supports export to multiple formats including PNG, SVG, and PDF for embedding
in documentation

**Definition**: web-based diagramming tool with real-time collaboration features,
extensive shape libraries, and integrations with documentation platforms

**Purpose**: enables teams to collaboratively create and maintain technical
diagrams with professional templates for system architecture, API flows, and
network topologies
