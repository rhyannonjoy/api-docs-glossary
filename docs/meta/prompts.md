## Annotated Screenshots

1. Attach published annotated screenshot examples
2. Attach current glossary term entry for context
3. Edit and execute the following:

```markdown
I'm working on the API Docs Glossary. Here are links to the GitHub
repository project and its rendered docs:

https://github.com/rhyannonjoy/api-docs-glossary
https://rhyannonjoy.github.io/api-docs-glossary/

I'd like to create an annotated screenshot for the `[glossary term]`
entry. What do you think should be annotated in this new screenshot?
Please create a Markdown table legend of components that you think
should be annotated in the screenshot. I've added an example annotated
screenshot for a published glossary term entry.
```

## Mermaid Diagrams

1. Attach current glossary term for context
2. Edit and execute the following:

```markdown
Please help me decide what will be the most impactful Mermaid diagram for
this glossary **Example** field scenario. I'm thinking a `[diagram type]`
diagram. Ensure that your output is in Markdown and Mermaid format, so that
I can copy and paste it easily.
```

>_Note: flowcharts TD tend to take up too much site real estate and
flowcharts RL tend to not be readable; you're more than likely going to
need a sequence diagram and if a flowchart is ideal, use Lucidchart_
