# Writing style

Language conventions, tone guidelines, and rhetorical approaches
that shape how API documentation communicates with its audience.
This section covers grammar distinctions, content strategy principles,
and stylistic choices that affect clarity, professionalism, and user
engagement in technical writing.

## active voice

**Definition**: sentence structure where the subject performs the
action rather than receiving it

**Purpose**: creates direct, clear communication that emphasizes
who does what in API documentation

**Example**:

- ✅ Active - "The API returns a JSON response"
- ❌ Passive - "A JSON response is returned by the API"

**Related Terms**: rhetorical approach, tone, voice

**Source**: [Style Guide](style-guide.md)

## affect vs effect

**Definition**: commonly confused words where "affect" typically
functions as a _verb_ meaning "to influence" and "effect" typically
functions as a _noun_ meaning "the result"

**Purpose**: maintains professional credibility and clarity in
technical writing by using correct grammar

**Example**:

- Verb - "API latency affects user experience"
- Noun - "The effect of caching improves response time"

**Related Terms**: content, voice

## content

**Definition**: anything written for someone else to read,
encompassing documentation, guides, reference materials,
and instructional text

**Purpose**: establishes the scope of technical communication work
and emphasizes the reader-focused nature of documentation

**Example**: API reference topics, tutorials, quickstart guides,
and conceptual explanations all constitute content

**Related Terms**: rhetorical approach, tone, voice

## rhetorical approach

**Definition**: framework that treats communication as action embedded
in culture, values, and power structures, recognizing that each
communication situation is unique and requires analysis of its
specific context

**Purpose**: ensures technical writers consider audience, purpose,
and context when crafting API documentation rather than applying
one-size-fits-all solutions

**Example**: choosing between formal reference documentation for
experienced developers versus conversational tutorials for beginners
demonstrates rhetorical awareness

**Related Terms**: active voice, content, tone, voice

## tone

**Definition**: the attitude or emotional quality conveyed through
word choice, sentence structure, and stylistic decisions in
written communication

**Purpose**: establishes the relationship between documentation
and readers, affecting engagement, trust, and comprehension

**Example**: conversational tone uses contractions and direct
address - "you'll need to authenticate," while formal tone avoids
both - "authentication is required"

**Related Terms**: active voice, rhetorical approach, voice

## voice

**Definition**: the consistent personality and perspective expressed
throughout documentation, distinct from tone which can vary by context

**Purpose**: creates cohesive documentation that readers recognize as
coming from a unified source regardless of who writes individual pieces

**Example**: a documentation voice might be "helpful but not condescending"
or "technically precise but accessible," maintained across all content types

**Related Terms**: active voice, rhetorical approach, tone
