## AI-assisted usability analysis

**Definition**: use of artificial intelligence tools to analyze
usability test results and identify patterns in user behavior or
interface issues

**Purpose**: accelerates analysis of certain types of usability
data while recognizing the limitations of AI in evaluating human
factors

**Appropriate use cases**:

- Mechanical tests: language clarity, navigation patterns,
consistency checks
- Pattern identification: recurring user errors, common
interaction sequences
- Quantitative analysis: time-on-task, completion rates,
click paths

**Limitations**:

- Cannot reliably assess human factors: credibility,
perception, satisfaction, emotional responses
- AI capabilities and best practices evolve rapidly, requiring
ongoing evaluation
- Results should supplement, not replace, human expertise in
usability research
- Interpretation quality depends on the specific AI tools and
prompts used

**Note**: this represents current perspectives on AI application
to usability testing and may evolve as AI capabilities develop

**Related Terms**: Guerrilla Usability Testing, usability testing
